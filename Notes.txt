1) On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, 
it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general 
data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at 
least as easy in Python as in those languages.

2) Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because 
no compilation and linking is necessary. 

3)What can Python do?
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
